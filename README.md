These are openHAB configuration files I use for my home automation system.

I control my heat/cooling system (Hitachi + Airzone), my pool, my VMC/CMV and smoke detectors.

Protocols used are:
- Modbus serial (Airzone)
- RFXCOM 433Mhz (Oregon probes)
- ZWave (Smoke detectors)
- One-wire (pool temperature probes)

For now, it is running under openHAB 1.x. I haven't made any test under openHAB 2.x.

Maybe I will make an architecture diagram sometimes... :-)
