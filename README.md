These are openHAB configuration files I use for my home automation system.

I control my heat/cooling system (Hitachi + Airzone), my pool and my VMC/CMV.

For now, it is running under openHAB 1.x. I haven't made any test under openHAB 2.x.

Maybe I will make an architecture diagram sometimes... :-)
